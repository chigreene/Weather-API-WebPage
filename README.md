# Weather API WebPage

## Description

The website provides the weather today and a five day forecast. Each searched city is saved to a favorites bar to provide easy access to past searches. 

- My motivation was to used my newly learned skills with local storage, data-indexes, and API fetches to solved a practical problem; knowing the weather for the week.
- I built this project because it a doable project to tackle and can be solved with the skills I have learned over the past two months.
- This project solves the problem of not knowing what the weather is like outside or for the next 4 days.
- What I learned is how to use local storage to create a history tab, how to use multiple API's and how to use function to create logic and control the flow of the program.
